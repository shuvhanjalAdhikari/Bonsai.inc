	                    <p>Internet can be a terrifying space. Identity hacking is just the tip of the iceberg on the downside of the internet. Instant access to any information can lead to many mishappenings and crimes as information can be used both ways. Spam advertsing misleads people and they always fall for traps laid out by the identity thives. Social media has created a massive platform that has raised issues among its users such as depression, low-self esteem and is very addictive.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> Users tend to use these platforms for hours at one sitting that wastes its users precious time. Studying in internet can sometimes be very hard as there is overwhelming amount of information where at times one contradicts the other making it very difficult to know whats correct.
