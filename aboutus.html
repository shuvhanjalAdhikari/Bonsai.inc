					<h4>Become better Acquainted With Our Members</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="about-content-wrapper">
					Our group consist of five members out of which one never showed so it’s the four of us. Shuvanjal is the leader of our team that is team 7. We have three more members, Jasmine,Nistha and Utsav. We started this project a month back. And took us a whole month and more. We worked day and nights to make it possible. It was a very learning experience for us. Our team assembled multiple times and worked hard. Our tutor Ayush Pandey helped us during the learning and working process.

We believe it’s the people and stories behind them that create the most genuine outcome. Our team consists of ambitious and driven candidates. Shuvhanjal is the leader of the team who possess self-awareness, exhibit humility, empower others to work in a team. The squad consists of three other members Jasmine,Nistha and Utsav who have all the qualities like honesty,integrity,courage,self-awareness which made our dreams change into reality. We as a team transformed complicated tedious processes and structures into a simple, delightful and almost easy to follow which made it so much fun and entertaining to complete the project.
